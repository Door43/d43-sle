The **Israelites** were angry when they found out that the **Gibeonites** had deceived them, but they kept the **peace** treaty they had made with them because it was a **promise** before God. Sometime later, the **kings** of another people group in **Canaan**, the **Amorites**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked **Gibeon**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to Joshua asking for help**.
